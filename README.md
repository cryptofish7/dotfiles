# My Dotfiles

My preferred setup is Neovim + Tmux + Mac OS Terminal + Bash..

This repo mainly contains my configurations to get those going.

To get started, you will need to first install:

- Neovim
- Tmux
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com) - This is to provide icons used in nvim-tree. I personally use Droid Sans.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), which are required for telescope.
- As well as any linters/formatters like prettierd.

Clone this repo into your home folder (`~`) to load the settings. 

Then copy .bash_profile to ~/.bash_profile to load bash settings.

Lastly, import `terminal_settings.terminal` into terminal and you're good to go.

P.S. if you're wondering what Karabiner is for, it's so I can rebind buttons on my Razer Naga mouse to play WoW ðŸ¤ª
